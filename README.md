## 📝 Project 1 — Study Habits Survey Form

This is my first project, a simple survey form built using **HTML**.  
It collects basic information about how students study and manage their time.

### 🔧 What I learned and implemented in my first 5 days:

- **Basic HTML page structure**
  - Using `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>`  

- **Headings and paragraphs**
  - `<h1>` for the title and `<p>` for descriptions  

- **Creating a form**
  - `<form>` element to group input fields  

- **Input fields**
  - Text input for name  
  - Email input with simple validation  
  - Number input with min and max values  

- **Labels**
  - `<label>` connected to inputs using `for` and `id`  

- **Dropdown menu**
  - `<select>` and `<option>` for choosing preferred study time  

- **Radio buttons**
  - Selecting one option (study alone or with others)  

- **Checkboxes**
  - Selecting multiple tools used to study  

- **Textarea**
  - Adding a field for extra comments  

- **Submit button**
  - `<button>` to submit the form

This project helped me practice **structuring a webpage, using forms, and working with different input types** during my first week of learning HTML.
