## 📝 Project 1 — Study Habits Survey Form
A simple survey form that collects information about students’ study habits.  
**What I learned:** basic HTML structure, headings, paragraphs, forms, text/email/number inputs, labels, dropdowns, radio buttons, checkboxes, textarea, submit button, and simple form validation.

## 📝 Project 2 — Hotel Feedback Form
A hotel feedback form to collect guest opinions.  
**What I learned:** using `<fieldset>` and `<legend>` to group form fields, more practice with inputs, radio buttons, checkboxes, dropdowns, textarea, labels, pre-selected options, and form validation.
