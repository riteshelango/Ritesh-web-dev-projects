## Project 3 — Interactive Greeting Card 🎉  
A fun and interactive birthday greeting card built with HTML and CSS. It includes animations, hover effects, and navigation between sections using links.  

**What I learned:**  
- Structuring content using `<div>`, `<section>`, and semantic HTML  
- Using CSS pseudo-classes like `:hover`, `:active`, `:focus`, `:visited`, and `:target`  
- Using CSS pseudo-elements like `::before` and `::after`  
- Adding transitions and transforms (`scale`, `skew`) for interactivity  
- Styling buttons, links, and layout with Flexbox
